### Abstract

Many NHS analysts are “lone coders,” trying to adopt reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP) without much local support. To try and help, The Strategy Unit have been running regular RAP drop-ins. This is a supportive space where analysts and managers alike can share challenges, swap tips, and ask the “silly” questions without judgement.

Questions often repeat, from convincing IT to allow new tools, to learning Git, to handling concerns about patient-identifiable data. What makes the sessions work is not having all the answers, but connecting people and learning together.

This talk will share the common themes we’ve heard so far, the lessons that have emerged, and how creating open, welcoming spaces helps make RAP more sustainable across the NHS.
