### Abstract

We needed to help NHS Trusts create reports summarising results from the New Hospital Programme Demand and Capacity Model.
These reports needed to be produced quickly, consistently, and reproducibly, incorporating plots and calculated values directly from model outputs.

While Quarto is highly regarded for programmatic document preparation, offering parameterisation, control, and reproducibility, we faced a challenge.
Colleagues had already developed a complex Word document with essential content.
Replacing it with a Quarto workflow would have required rebuilding from scratch, causing friction for users reliant on Word.

Instead, we developed a 'one-click' workflow in R using the {officer} package.
This allowed us to programmatically insert images and values into the Word template at predefined locations, with dynamic content based on the Trust.
This approach preserved the document format while adding automation and reproducibility.

In this presentation, we'll share how we balanced the 'fragility and agility' of developing around the Word template; iterated, documented, and collaborated effectively through GitHub; and challenged the assumption that Quarto is always the best solution. We will cover the technical aspects of how {officer} inserts generated plots and values into Word documents, our function-led development approach, and the flexibility to adapt to changing needs and an expanding template.

We've now successfully produced numerous reports, streamlined reporting, aided the development of adjacent products, and demonstrated that sometimes the best solution is to meet users where they are, rather than forcing the 'correct' solution.

The GitHub repository will be opened for others to see and adopt our approach.
